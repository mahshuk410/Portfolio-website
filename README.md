# Portfolio-website



Your Project's Name
==================================================================
This webpage is a personal eportfolio website created to reach out to HR managers who would be eager to hire me. If I were to be the user(HR or employer),I would want this potential interviewee to possess the basic skills of a tech professional.Additionally,I would want to see his educational background.Then,I would look for any unique traits or experiences he would have to differentiate him from other candidates.

Likewise,as a designer of this webpage I made sure all these expectations have been met.



Design Process
==============================================================
Insights:I designed my website with a background to add vibrance to it.
I supported my texts with clear and distinct headings to tell the user
which segment of the content he is currently reading. As much as I could,I supported my statements with images to make sure they are concrete. As the saying goes,"All talk and no action".Any job applicants can fabricate stories or content,but show no proof to claim ownership of that content.

I also added some div background colors with transparency to make the paragraph stand out more whilst retaining the original background.
Added some social media icons,colored with adobe illustrator.
Icons:
"Portfolio-website\icon-library\instagram.svg"
"Portfolio-website\icon-library\linkedin.svg"
"Portfolio-website\icon-library\facebook-circular-logo.svg"
Adobe XD Wireframe:"Portfolio-website/OriginalWireframe.xd"


Features
==================================================================
Mouse hover: In order to make buttons appear interactive & appealing to users,I have added the color change feature when the cursor hovers those buttons.
Navigation bar: Allows user to toggle between different pages of the website.
Email feature : Allows interested users(employers) to contact me by entering the name and message in the form on page 4 "Connect with me" section.



Technologies Used
==============================================================
Coding languages:"https://code.visualstudio.com/"

3)Adobe Illustrator : "https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/illustrator.html?sdid=XXTQH4ZY&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAwf39BRCCARIsALXWETwM1CMnC1rFfA0CL69oEt2fcXzaMrjM5XklqvT1Kq2VS7fwhPnU3RIaArGXEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!403545334018!e!!g!!adobe%20illustrator&gclid=Cj0KCQiAwf39BRCCARIsALXWETwM1CMnC1rFfA0CL69oEt2fcXzaMrjM5XklqvT1Kq2VS7fwhPnU3RIaArGXEALw_wcB"
Illustrator was used to colorise and vectorise the social media icons that I had retrieved from the internet.
