                Hello!I am a year 1 student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic,School of InfoComm Technology(ICT).Outside of school, I am a cricket enthusiast and love watching Netflix shows. As a former NCC cadet,I like military-related activites and shows.</p>
                <p>IT has been a major turning point of my life. Recently,I have picked up coding as a new interest. Astounded by the limitless capabilites of programming, I am spurred to learn more coding and construct programs.</p>
                <p>As an adventurous person,
                     I am open to learning new skills and build myself along the way, which I believe will sustain me in the tech industry. </p></div>
