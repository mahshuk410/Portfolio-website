# Project's Name
==================================================================
This webpage is a personal eportfolio website created to reach out to HR managers who would be eager to hire me. If I was an employer,I would want this potential interviewee to possess :

As a designer of this webpage I made sure all these expectations have been met.

# Features & Design Process
==================================================================
## Site Background
* designed my website with a background to add vibrance to it.
## Sites images & School logos
* As much as I could,I supported my statements with images to make sure they are concrete. As the saying goes,"All talk and no action".Any job applicants can fabricate stories or content,but show no proof to claim ownership of that content.
## Paragraph & Sections
* Add some background colors with transparency to make the paragraph stand out more whilst retaining the original background.
* Colors aimed to make content easier to read **especially for visually impaired** .
## Mouse hover: In order to make buttons appear interactive & appealing to users,I have added the color change feature when the cursor hovers those buttons.
* Text color changes to green when hovered,as green provides freshness to user's eyes with the smooth hover animation.
## Navigation bar: Allows user to toggle between different pages of the website.
## Website Icon :Makes my website more recongisable
  * computer-shaped icon
  * greenish-pixels with "M" letter masked to create contrast 
  *design principle :Contrast*
