                Hello!I am a year 1 student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic.Growing up in an Indian family,I was told to get a 9-5 job and settle down in life.
            One example was the IT sector.Well, IT Jobs = good pay.Right?.. NOPE.Personally,I felt that IT was for me because of the countless windows of job opportunities and adventures that can come my way.As an adventurous person,
        I am ready to learn new skills and knowledge : an essential trait needed to stay relevant in this field. Secondly,I know that IT will allow to
    make a difference in people's lives while working alongside with my company and peers.It is the derived satisfaction that drives me forward to do more good.</p></div>

                        National Cadet Corps(NCC) as my CCA was the juncture for me to develop holistic skills and knowledge . 
                        NCC trainings exposed me to physical training sessions, army survival basics. During my Upper Secondary years, 
                        I studied Elementary and Additional Mathematics and Pure Sciences - Physics and Chemistry. As I was nearing my O-levels,
                        I was thinking of my future career.My passion for engineering was fading..And I knew that I had to pursue a career that will be more sustainable and
                        rewarding. Graduating with a GCE O-level certificate , my life took a turn for the better...</p></div>

                        Browsing through polytechnic course booklets day and night,I filtered off the courses which did not suit my expectations or interests. 
                        One day, the jobs in the Tech Industry captivated me. With its pre-requisites matching my strong subject, Mathematics, 
                        and as a highly-sought after career in the workforce, I decided to give it a go. Eventually , I applied for a place in Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
                         Diploma in Information Technology and made the cut.</p></div>
